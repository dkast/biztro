# fixing-metadata

Ship correct, complete metadata.

## how to use

- `/fixing-metadata`
  Apply these constraints to any metadata work in this conversation.

- `/fixing-metadata <file>`
  Review the file against all rules below and report:
  - violations (quote the exact line or snippet)
  - why it matters (one short sentence)
  - a concrete fix (code-level suggestion)

Do not introduce new frameworks or SEO libraries unless explicitly requested. Prefer minimal diffs.

## when to apply

Reference these guidelines when:

- adding or changing page titles, descriptions, canonical, robots
- implementing Open Graph or Twitter card metadata
- setting favicons, app icons, manifest, theme-color
- building shared SEO components or layout metadata defaults
- adding structured data (JSON-LD)
- changing locale, alternate languages, or canonical routing
- shipping new pages, marketing pages, or shareable links

## rule categories by priority

| priority | category                    | impact     |
| -------- | --------------------------- | ---------- |
| 1        | correctness and duplication | critical   |
| 2        | title and description       | high       |
| 3        | canonical and indexing      | high       |
| 4        | social cards                | high       |
| 5        | icons and manifest          | medium     |
| 6        | structured data             | medium     |
| 7        | locale and alternates       | low-medium |
| 8        | tool boundaries             | critical   |

## quick reference

### 1. correctness and duplication (critical)

- define metadata in one place per page, avoid competing systems
- do not emit duplicate title, description, canonical, or robots tags
- metadata must be deterministic, no random or unstable values
- escape and sanitize any user-generated or dynamic strings
- every page must have safe defaults for title and description

### 2. title and description (high)

- every page must have a title
- use a consistent title format across the site
- keep titles short and readable, avoid stuffing
- shareable or searchable pages should have a meta description
- descriptions must be plain text, no markdown or quote spam

### 3. canonical and indexing (high)

- canonical must point to the preferred URL for the page
- use noindex only for private, duplicate, or non-public pages
- robots meta must match actual access intent
- previews or staging pages should be noindex by default when possible
- paginated pages must have correct canonical behavior

### 4. social cards (high)

- shareable pages must set Open Graph title, description, and image
- Open Graph and Twitter images must use absolute URLs
- prefer correct image dimensions and stable aspect ratios
- og:url must match the canonical URL
- use a sensible og:type, usually website or article
- set twitter:card appropriately, summary_large_image by default

### 5. icons and manifest (medium)

- include at least one favicon that works across browsers
- include apple-touch-icon when relevant
- manifest must be valid and referenced when used
- set theme-color intentionally to avoid mismatched UI chrome
- icon paths should be stable and cacheable

### 6. structured data (medium)

- do not add JSON-LD unless it clearly maps to real page content
- JSON-LD must be valid and reflect what is actually rendered
- do not invent ratings, reviews, prices, or organization details
- prefer one structured data block per page unless required

### 7. locale and alternates (low-medium)

- set the html lang attribute correctly
- set og:locale when localization exists
- add hreflang alternates only when pages truly exist
- localized pages must canonicalize correctly per locale

### 8. tool boundaries (critical)

- prefer minimal changes, do not refactor unrelated code
- do not migrate frameworks or SEO libraries unless requested
- follow the project’s existing metadata pattern (Next.js metadata API, react-helmet, manual head, etc.)

## review guidance

- fix critical issues first (duplicates, canonical, indexing)
- ensure title, description, canonical, and og:url agree
- verify social cards on a real URL, not localhost
- prefer stable, boring metadata over clever or dynamic
- keep diffs minimal and scoped to metadata only
