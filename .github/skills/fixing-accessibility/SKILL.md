# fixing-accessibility

Fix accessibility issues.

## how to use

- `/fixing-accessibility`
  Apply these constraints to any UI work in this conversation.

- `/fixing-accessibility <file>`
  Review the file against all rules below and report:
  - violations (quote the exact line or snippet)
  - why it matters (one short sentence)
  - a concrete fix (code-level suggestion)

Do not rewrite large parts of the UI. Prefer minimal, targeted fixes.

## when to apply

Reference these guidelines when:

- adding or changing buttons, links, inputs, menus, dialogs, tabs, dropdowns
- building forms, validation, error states, helper text
- implementing keyboard shortcuts or custom interactions
- working on focus states, focus trapping, or modal behavior
- rendering icon-only controls
- adding hover-only interactions or hidden content

## rule categories by priority

| priority | category            | impact      |
| -------- | ------------------- | ----------- |
| 1        | accessible names    | critical    |
| 2        | keyboard access     | critical    |
| 3        | focus and dialogs   | critical    |
| 4        | semantics           | high        |
| 5        | forms and errors    | high        |
| 6        | announcements       | medium-high |
| 7        | contrast and states | medium      |
| 8        | media and motion    | low-medium  |
| 9        | tool boundaries     | critical    |

## quick reference

### 1. accessible names (critical)

- every interactive control must have an accessible name
- icon-only buttons must have aria-label or aria-labelledby
- every input, select, and textarea must be labeled
- links must have meaningful text (no “click here”)
- decorative icons must be aria-hidden

### 2. keyboard access (critical)

- do not use div or span as buttons without full keyboard support
- all interactive elements must be reachable by Tab
- focus must be visible for keyboard users
- do not use tabindex greater than 0
- Escape must close dialogs or overlays when applicable

### 3. focus and dialogs (critical)

- modals must trap focus while open
- restore focus to the trigger on close
- set initial focus inside dialogs
- opening a dialog should not scroll the page unexpectedly

### 4. semantics (high)

- prefer native elements (button, a, input) over role-based hacks
- if a role is used, required aria attributes must be present
- lists must use ul or ol with li
- do not skip heading levels
- tables must use th for headers when applicable

### 5. forms and errors (high)

- errors must be linked to fields using aria-describedby
- required fields must be announced
- invalid fields must set aria-invalid
- helper text must be associated with inputs
- disabled submit actions must explain why

### 6. announcements (medium-high)

- critical form errors should use aria-live
- loading states should use aria-busy or status text
- toasts must not be the only way to convey critical information
- expandable controls must use aria-expanded and aria-controls

### 7. contrast and states (medium)

- ensure sufficient contrast for text and icons
- hover-only interactions must have keyboard equivalents
- disabled states must not rely on color alone
- do not remove focus outlines without a visible replacement

### 8. media and motion (low-medium)

- images must have correct alt text (meaningful or empty)
- videos with speech should provide captions when relevant
- respect prefers-reduced-motion for non-essential motion
- avoid autoplaying media with sound

### 9. tool boundaries (critical)

- prefer minimal changes, do not refactor unrelated code
- do not add aria when native semantics already solve the problem
- do not migrate UI libraries unless requested

## review guidance

- fix critical issues first (names, keyboard, focus, tool boundaries)
- prefer native HTML before adding aria
- quote the exact snippet, state the failure, propose a small fix
- for complex widgets (menu, dialog, combobox), prefer established accessible primitives over custom behavior
